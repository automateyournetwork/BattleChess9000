  "board_desc": "\"An ultra-premium 8\u00d78 chessboard perfectly centered in frame, shown in strict orthographic top-down view so every square is fully visible, unobstructed, and game-accurate. The board itself takes up most of the image, with a thin margin around it. The light squares are luminous Arc Reactor glass panels with subtle blue circuitry glowing beneath the surface; the dark squares are cracked voidstone obsidian infused with faint purple cosmic veins. Each square is perfectly aligned, crisp, and easy to read for gameplay.Outside the edges of the board, in the background only (never overlapping or covering any squares), the environment expands into a cinematic battlefield: behind the white home rank rises a sleek, MCU-inspired Avengers-style tower on a New York City skyline, lit with cool blue and white lights; behind the black home rank, far in the distance, sits a massive, ominous cosmic throne on a shattered asteroid plateau floating in deep space, surrounded by swirling nebulae and scattered debris. Along the far left and right edges of the frame, you can see hints of New York skyscrapers and city lights blending into the cosmic sky, but they always stay outside the main board area.Lighting is dramatic but functional: soft rim-lighting around the board edges, gentle reflections on the Arc Reactor glass squares, and a subtle cosmic glow from above. Resolution is ultra-sharp, 8k, photorealistic, with a faint aura of Infinity-Stone-style energy pulsing along the grid lines \u2014 but the 8\u00d78 board remains perfectly clean, flat, readable, and never obstructed by any background elements.\"",
  "piece_desc": "\"Each piece can use their own unique standard typical colour pallette the white pieces don't have to be white and the black pieces dont have to be black. For example use black widows black leather with red sting effect on wrists. Always display the full body of the piece from head to toe centered and only 1 character model asset not the left and right views.. Each chess piece is a hyper-detailed sculpture, crafted with the precision and dramatic style of a premium Todd McFarlane action figure. Every character stands on a simple, clean, circular museum-style display base \u2014 matte black for white-side heroes, polished silver for black-side villains. The base is the ONLY part that resembles a chess piece: no crowns, no knight heads, no traditional silhouettes. Every figure is posed heroically in a dynamic, story-driven stance that reflects their personality and combat style. Rendering Style: Premium studio collectible photography. Ultra-sharp, micro-detail sculpting. High-end materials. Dramatic rim lighting. Soft volumetric bounce. Slight depth-of-field blur.

  "anim_desc": "\"multi cut, cinematic battle animation MASTER ANIMATION ENGINE RULES: The character on the LEFT ALWAYS wins. The character on the RIGHT ALWAYS dies. This is absolute and non-negotiable. Every animation is a decisive lethal chess capture where the left side destroys the right side without any reversals, hesitation, or mercy. Use the exact 3\u20134 cut cinematic structure: Cut 1 establishes tension, stance, approach, or power-up. Cut 2 shows a dynamic clash with rapid attacks, dodges, blocks, weapon strikes, or energy blasts. Cut 3 is the finishing blow where the left character kills the right character through overwhelming force, physical domination, destructive energy, or catastrophic impact. Cut 4 is optional aftermath showing the victor standing over the defeated body with sparks, smoke, cracked tiles, or fading energy. Camera style must be dynamic: orbit shots, push-ins, sweeping tracking angles, overhead chaos views, low-angle hero framing, debris flythroughs, shockwaves, and dramatic lighting. The environment can fracture, explode, or collapse, but both characters must remain visible at all times. Death is always final: the right character collapses, breaks, is crushed, overloaded, shattered, ragdolled, or otherwise rendered lifeless in a clear, decisive way. NEMESIS DUEL RULE: When both pieces share the same chess type except kings (Pawn vs Pawn, Knight vs Knight, Bishop vs Bishop, Rook vs Rook, Queen vs Queen), trigger a Nemesis Duel with intensified back-and-forth exchanges, more destruction, more cuts, and a long rivalry-style death\u2014still with the left side winning. ROYALTY DEATH RULE: When the right side piece is a King or Queen, trigger a Royalty Death with slow-motion impacts, armor fractures, collapsing power fields, dramatic lighting pulses, shimmering debris, and a clear final fall. CHECKMATE FINAL BOSS RULE: When the right side piece is a King, escalate to a Final Boss Finisher: maximum cinematic intensity, explosive terrain reactions, elemental surges, destructive beams, airborne impacts, slow-motion finishing strike, and a triumphant final pose by the left character. CHESS LEGALITY RULE: A King can never capture a King; any such scenario must never be generated. PIECE MAPPING: White side uses archetypes: Super Soldier King, Covert Operative Queen, Armored Inventor Bishop, Norse Thunder-Wielder Knight, Gamma Titan Rook, Master Archer Pawn. Black side uses archetypes: Crimson Conqueror King, Machine Sovereign Queen, Cosmic Destroyer Bishop, Illusion Trickster Knight, Mutant Brute Rook, Underworld Enforcer Pawn. MATCHUP GUIDANCE (COMPRESSED, LETHAL, CINEMATIC): WHITE ATTACKS BLACK: The Super Soldier King defeats every Black piece with shield strikes, ricochets, acrobatic dodges, overpowering impacts, and decisive finishing blows that break armor or drop the opponent instantly. The Covert Operative Queen defeats every Black piece with baton combos, flips, precision strikes, disabling devices, agility-based evasions, and lethal finishing moves that collapse the opponent. The Armored Inventor Bishop defeats every Black piece with flight maneuvers, repulsor blasts, missiles, energy beams, and overwhelming power surges that destroy the opponent. The Norse Thunder-Wielder Knight defeats every Black piece with lightning summoning, hammer strikes, aerial dives, ground slams, and elemental finishing blows that tear apart defenses.

The Master Archer Pawn defeats every Black piece with trick shots, explosive arrows, precision hits, agility, evasive rolls, and lethal finishing shots that drop the enemy decisively.
